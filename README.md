# SimpleToDo

This is a Simple To-Do List Mobile Application.

A user can add things to do and a notification will pop up up indicating that an item has been added.

If the user long presses on an item, a dialog box pops up asking the user if he/she is sure to delete the item. If 'Cancel' is clicked, it will bring back the user to the To-Do List View, but if 'Ok' is clicked, the item selected will be deleted.
